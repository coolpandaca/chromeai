## Discussion Group
With our smart bot and advanced language capabilities already in place, it's the perfect time to explore a fun new idea that could take our interactions to the next level. Imagine chatting with a group of bots that can debate and discuss topics together—kind of like a lively discussion board or a chat group. Not only would this make conversations even more engaging, but it would also give us the chance to explore fresh ideas and perspectives in a dynamic, collaborative, and enjoyable way!

Currently, I have four different characters with different backgrounds.
- Rapper
- Shy girl
- Scholar
- Housewife

Feel free to experiment with your character's personality or traits - it's all part of the creative process! To do this, simply adjust the system prompt if it needs to, and provide a thought-provoking topic. Then, let's see where four fascinating characters take the conversation! Watching them engage in lively debates, share ideas, and learn from one another is truly amazing - it's a joy to witness the sparks of creativity fly!
I'd love to share with you the snapshots I've taken of our characters' reactions to various topics, including economic, political, and emotional issues. You'll see them respond in a remarkably human way, with all the complexities and nuances that make us relatable. I invite you to look and experience the depth of their personalities for yourself – I hope you'll find it enlightening and engaging!

## How to use it
I would like to minimize the customer installation to explore the large language modelling and try to be able to demo as easy as possible. Since Google have already published the embedded AI Gemini Nano as experimental in Chrome for a while, I would give this a shot. If you have not heard or install it, here are the documentations to install to your browser. https://chromeai.org. There is also a youtube video about how to setup, but the code API is out of date: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ODqhS-213iE

Then just give a topic and let your character rock. The single page application is at https://coolpandaca.github.io/chromeai/

On the implementation side, I am using a combination of plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring everything to life. And the best part? It is using a self-contained approach, meaning all calculations and data are stored locally on your device, making it perfect for offline use. That's why the app is hosted on GitHub Pages, where you can easily access and try it out. I am excited for you to experience the freedom and flexibility that comes with using our app, so why not give it a spin and see how it works?

## After thought

### The Power of the Nano Model

You're already aware that our application is running on the powerful Gemini Nano model, which is remarkably compact. And the best part? You can experience its impressive capabilities without breaking the bank - in fact, it's more accessible than ever!

### Bot Spam

You can see within 200 lines of code; you can create a human like bot so easily. I was very worried about that social media website can use this kind of technologies to fake a lot of users. I assume they have already done all things. Also, you can imagine that those board can mislead the real people into different social directions. This may or may not be a marketing nightmare.

### Exploring new topic

Embracing diversity in perspectives is where the magic truly comes alive! By crafting unique characters with diverse backgrounds, you can unlock a deeper understanding of how people interact and express themselves on various subjects. This approach can be incredibly enlightening, revealing fresh insights that might surprise and inspire you. It's a more engaging and effective way to explore new topics, and one that can be especially empowering when collaborating with chatbots like ChatGPT, rather than relying solely on direct questioning. As you delve into these diverse perspectives, you may also discover hidden gems and new information that you might have otherwise overlooked.

### Brainstorm assistant

Have you ever considered exploring different character profiles to spice up your discussions? Imagine bringing together people (AI bots) with unique backgrounds, such as a retired soldier, a marketing expert, a social worker, a staved student, and more! You'd be amazed at the fascinating conversations and innovative ideas that could emerge. For example, let's discuss how to increase product prices, launch a new product line, or raise minimum wages. You'd be thrilled to observe the diverse behaviors and reactions that would unfold. This could be the key to unlocking a whole new world of possibilities for us!
